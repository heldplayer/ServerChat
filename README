Stop trying to chat to me on IRC, steam and FB, use twitch chat instead


Client with the mod connects to server with the mod
=> Client stores that the server has the mod installed

Client connects to different server
=> Sends that the first server has the mod
=> Server attempts to contact the server
=> If successfull, connection is saved, otherwise client gets told the server is invalid


Server:
servers.json - List of servers to connect to (IP + UUID)


Client:
servers.json - List of servers that have the mod installed (IP + UUID)
Has chat window to chat to channels + users


Notes:
Don't use Netty for inter-server comm to allow the code to be used for multiple platforms (Forge, bukkit, etc...)

Authentication:
If a server claims it is authenticated to perform actions to the network, it checks with a main database/site
to check if the claim is legit


When a server first gets this mod installed, a UUID is made, together with a KeyPair. The UUID and public key are
sent to the central repository.

When a server tries to connect to a different server, they both request the UUID and a random number and its signature
The other server requests the public key of the server with the UUID from the central repository and verifies that
the signature of matches.

If it doesn't match, the connection is revoked, otherwise the connection is instantiated and the servers share details
